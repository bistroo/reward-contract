# Bistroo Reward Contract
Referral rewards for Bistroo consumers referring new consumers or merchants (referrals).
We have visualised the process in the schematic and applications design below.

## Process flow

######Roles:
* Referrer: Consumer who refers a referral to activate a Bistroo account
* Referral: A potential new consumer or merchant

######Process
1. The referrer gets and shares a referrer link with a referral
2. The referral clicks on the link and registers the reference by signing a message
3.  The referral activates the reward by performing a required activity:
    * A referral consumer registers and pays for an order
    *  referral merchant activates a store
4. The referrer receives a referrer reward
